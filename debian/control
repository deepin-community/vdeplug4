Description: Virtual Distributed Ethernet: A modular virtual plug to the VDE
 VDE provides a versatile support to create Ethernet compliant
 virtual networks. The vdeplug library, like an ethernet plug, can
 be used to connect virtual machines, namespaces, IoTh (Internet
 of Threads) processes or VDE utility commands to virtual networks.
 .
 This library uses plug-ins to support several VDE implementations
 and to be open to new developments in virtual networking.
 .
 Several plugins are included as standard extensions of the library, e.g.:
  - vde: connect to legacy vde_switch (provided by vde2) or
    to virtual networking sockets, see below
  - vxvde: this plug-in implements distributed virtual switches
    (implementation of a Local Area Cloud)
  - tap: connect to a tuntap interface
  - udp: udp tunnelling
  - ptp: point to point connection
  - vxlan: the plug becomes a vxlan's VTEP
  - cmd: stream the network flow to a command
 A plug can provide virtual networking sockets where other plug can
 be connected (using the vde plugin)
  - hub: the plug implements a hub
  - switch: the plug implements a switch
 .
 This package contains some utility tools for VDE including vde_plug.
